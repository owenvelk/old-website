 A personal website to represent myself, my education, and my development experience.

 This website is a work in progress, and will continually evolve as I learn and develop new skills in front- end development.
 If you find this at a time where you are unimpressed, I promise you I am too. But I also promise you that I'll get there.

 Anyways, thanks for checking out my website!
